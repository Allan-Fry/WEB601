I have decided on my project. For this class I will make a genirect product web site which allows small businesses to advitise there
products. The website will allow people who don't have have websites of their own can eaierly advitise online as well as people who
want to find the product they want.


We started this class with the highlevel discription of a basic discription of the product. We went over a basic diagram and with 
basic terminoligy for the use of a web app. We have cover this in a previous leason by this discription made it made more scense to
me. Being able to discuse a project in the most basic terms is important when it comes to talking to clients as client might get lost
if they don't understand what you are trying to communicate. This is an important skill for me to learn as I struggle to clearly 
explain my point and to give the necisery details.


I struggling to understand what express.js is. I believe that express is a code liberay built on node.js, it's most important feature
is how it is customisable. Node.js is a liberary which allow for webcommunications. The node.js is allows for connections between servers
and other computers by creating conections called sockets, which is a cocept that I am struggling to understand but I think that this
might be a little advance for where I currenetly am at. How I understand is that Javascript can communicate with the hardware of a server
so node.js allows for translation between the two.

Note: I called node,js and express.js liberaies they are actually frameworks.

While using code libariaries it is important to make sure that they are up to date before they become an important part of you app.
This can be done by using github to check how active the repository is when, howmany issue their are and when it was last updated.
The reason only using currently manatained code is important is that if the code is not being mantained error and issues will occure
and wont be resolved. It is also important to find work arounds for issues as the people updating the repository might not resolve issues
straight away.
