This web we focused on leaning how to work with Git and git hub.

Github is a website which can be used to manage code. 
Using git we can upload our code, divide our code into different sections and merge code branchs together.
Once we are finished working on our code we can commit and push it to github which stores the code and allows other github users
to see and possibly contribute to the code.

Github hub also funtions as a sort of social network for programers. Many programers use github to network with others in the 
industry or as a CV for job interviews. Github hub tracks how much a user interacts with the site/ how much they contribute to 
repostories. This activity tracking allow potential employers to see how the user works. Activity tracking also allows users to
form bounds with each other letting them effectively social network.

Git and by extention github let users manage there code though branching. A branch is a copy of a set of code which can be
work on without effecting the main piece of code. Branchs can be created form a branch and more than one branch can be created
at a time. 

Branching allows multiple programers to all work on a piece of code at the same time. Multiple people can each have their
own branchs allowing them to not have to work about other users overriding the work they have completed.
