During this lesion we covered the differents between javascript classes, funtions and propts. These are called components.

Funtions are basic they allow for code to be quickly ran and don't clutter your code like a class will. Funtions are consider stateless as they
only have the ability to run their code and don't remember any of the other funtions.
Classes are more complicated than Funtions have additionl features such as storing varables. As they store varable they are considered stateful
Although some people might recommend not using classes out teach does as it is extremely useful to be able to take advantages of classes
Propts are components which have the ability to store data and that is it. They can be passed to classes and used to more around data.

Examples:
Funtion: preform a spicific equation.
Classes: preform an equation basied on it's state
Propts: pass a value into classes to be added.


We covered how to take advantage of react parent child relationships. This was something that I took advantage of for milestone one.
A react componed can be placed within another component and then that component can be called from the root.
This allows us to be able to render multiple components at the sametime. I currently am not sure how to properly load a component 
after a piece of child code. For example I would like to have my header and footer on every page and then content inbetween but I 
don't know how to load the footer with out loading it as a child as well. I will need to look into this in the future, I believe that
it has some relation to boiler plates so that might be a place to look into.

We covered differnet types of styling. Inline styles are bad and I will not consider using them. I am currently using a css file
but there is an additional type of file which I might want to look into doing. Style components allow us to download style tempaltes
and applie them to each components, this is simlar to an inline style but doesn't have a lot of the downsides to inline styles.

I might look into this as I am not good at web designs so this could help me make my website more polished looking. It also prevents
me from forgeting an interferrinh tag which could coarse issues, which is a common problem I have.

Another example is CSS in javascript which lets us write CSS in javascript. This isn't popular as it can add a large amount of code
to the project, but it allows for a large amount of work to be preformed at once.
